                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>My current favorite video game is Destiny 2. However, I have also been playing Fallout 4, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Halo on occasion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="styled-div-2">
                <h2>PC Building</h2>
                <p>I am currently building a gaming PC in my free time. It has been very entertaining to learn what each part does and how they all work together. This is a very expensive hobby so I have been saving up money for a few months to afford all of the parts, I hope to finish my PC in May.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="styled-div-3">
                <h2>Guitar</h2>
                <p>I learned to play guitar in Highschool but took a break from it for a bit. On my mission I served with a companion who was very good at playing the guitar. He got me back into the hobby and I've been playing ever since then.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="styled-div-4">
                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>I started doing photography in Highschool. A big part of my mom's job is photography so after watching her work for years I finally decided to start experimenting with photography for my own. Today I still do photography and have even used it in professional settings.</p>
